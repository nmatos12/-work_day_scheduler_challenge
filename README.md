# Work Day Scheduler Challenge

## Description

In this challenge we were tasked with using jQuery to create a scheduler for users to plan their workday. This application was designed to store events through local storage for the average 9-to-5 work day and to retrieve that data for users even if they close that page. Through this application users can more efficiently plan and mangae their events for the day. As a developer, I was able to practice key concepts such as: local storage, jQuery, dayjs, and the remove/addClass methods.
